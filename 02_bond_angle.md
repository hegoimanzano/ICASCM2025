# Topology

In any molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package, a **topology** file (sometimes also called a _structure_ or _data file_) is a critical component of the simulation. While the input script tells the program _how to run_ the dynamics (ensembles, temperature control, run length, etc.), the topology tells it _what system_ is being simulated. This includes a complete description of all particles: their identifiers, element or species type, masses, charges, and spatial coordinates, along with the connectivity information that defines which atoms are bonded and how angles and dihedrals are defined. Without such information, the force field cannot assign the correct interactions. In short, the topology is the “map” that defines the system at the atomic scale.

Constructing this file correctly is often the most tedious part of a simulation. In a system with more than 1,000 atoms, it is necessary to define thousands of bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc., which is not straightforward. Here, we will build the topology file using **VMD** (Visual Molecular Dynamics) starting from the atomic structure generated by the pyCSH code. VMD is a molecular visualisation program for biomolecular systems but it is useful for preparing topology files for LAMMPS.

> ✒️ Both **advanced** and **novice users** will build the LAMMPS data file with the full topological information using VMD from the terminal with scripts. _Estimated time XXX min_.

```{Note}
There are alternative ways to generate topology files, from automated tools such as LigParGen or Moltemplate to custom scripts using Python and ASE. Each method offers different levels of flexibility and complexity.

### LAMMPS topology file

```{Note}
Users with experience with force fields that require topology (ClayFF, CSHFF, CHARMM, OPLS, etc.) can skip this section.
```

In LAMMPS, the topological information is usually stored in a **data file**, which is read using the `read_data` command. The structure of this file is modular and well defined:

- A **header** section specifies the total and type numbers of atoms, bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers, as well as the dimensions of the simulation box.
- A **Masses** section assigns masses to each atom type.
- An **Atoms** section provides, for each atom, its ID, molecule ID (if relevant), atom type, charge, and coordinates (x, y, z). Depending on the chosen `atom_style` in the input file, additional fields may appear, such as velocities, dipoles, or extra properties.
- Optional **Bonds, Angles, Dihedrals, and Impropers** sections describe bonded connectivity, listing the IDs of the participating atoms and their type.

As an example, the following snippet shows a LAMMPS data file for a water molecule:

```lammps

2 1 2  0.410  10.0  9.9 10.7   # H_w (water hydrogen)
3 1 2  0.410  10.0  8.1 10.0   # H_w (water hydrogen)

Bonds # bond-ID bond-type atom1 atom2

1 1 1 2   # O_w – H_w (water bond)
2 1 1 3   # O_w – H_w (water bond)

Angles # angle-ID angle-type atom1 atom2 atom3

1 1 2 1 3  # H_w – O_w – H_w (water angle) 
```

```{Note}
**Atom styles and force fields** The structure of a LAMMPS data file partly depends on the force field being used, as each force field requires a specific `atom_style`. For instance, classical force fields such as CHARMM, AMBER, or ClayFF use the `full` style. This format explicitly lists all topological terms (bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers) together with atom types, masses, charges, and coordinates. In contrast, ReaxFF does not rely on predefined connectivity and the data files should use the `charge` style, which only specifies atom IDs, types, charges, masses, and coordinates.  

Regardless of the force field, the **data file must be consistent with the `atom_style` defined in the input script**, otherwise the simulation will fail to read it correctly. You can find a complete description of all available atom styles and their required fields in the [LAMMPS documentation](https://docs.lammps.org/atom_style.html).

### ClayFF atom types 

[ClayFF](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp0363287) was originally developed to describe clays and layered silicates, but has become common for modelling calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) and related phases. Its key advantage lies in its simplicity: ClayFF is essentially a non-bonded force field in which most atoms interact only through Lennard–Jones and Coulombic terms. The only exceptions are hydroxyl and water molecules, where explicit O–H bonds and H–O–H angles are included to preserve molecular geometry. The assigned charges are fractional (e.g., O ≈ –1.05 e and Si ≈ +2.1 e instead their formal charges -2 and +4) and were originally parameterised for clay minerals (see the **Caution** note).

ClayFF defines a limited set of atom types, each with specific Lennard–Jones parameters and partial charges. pyCSH writes a detailed label for each atom type, and you need to understand their correspondence:

```{Caution}
Clays are phyllosilicates, whereas tobermorite minerals and C–S–H are inosilicates, so applying ClayFF’s standard partial charges to these systems often produces a non-neutral configuration. Maintaining electroneutrality is crucial to obtain stable and physically meaningful simulations. It is therefore **essential** to ensure that your system is **neutral**, i.e., that the sum of both formal and partial charges equals zero. For that, the partial charges can be slightly adjusted.

**Important**: the same issue applies to any force field that uses partial charges when "defects" are introduced, such as CSHFF or OPLS.


To solve the charge problem, count the number of atoms of each element (M), multiply it by its partial charge ($q_j$), and sum over all the elements (N). The sum (Q) must be zero. If it is not, distribute the excess charge evenly among all oxygen atoms of the C-S-H (O, Osi, Oca):

$$
Q = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{M} q_j    \qquad  \qquad  q_{new} = q_{old} - Q/N_{O}
$$

This correction is acceptable as long as the charge is modified by a tiny percentage (typically less than 0.005%). Under these conditions, the effect on the Coulombic interactions is negligible, and the force field can be expected to behave consistently with the original parametrization.

### Generating the topology file in VMD

In this section, we will learn how to create a LAMMPS data file from the structure generated by pyCSH, using VMD and its plugins *TopoTools* and *PBCtools*. Although it is possible to execute the commands directly from the `Tk Console` in VMD, in this tutorial we will use a Tcl script — a plain-text file containing the VMD commands necessary to generate the LAMMPS data file. Using this script has two key advantages:
- it ensures the process is reproducible and less prone to manual errors.
- it allows batch processing, i.e., generating data files for many structures in sequence reusing the Tcl script.

**1. Building the Tcl script**

Open a text editor and create a new file, for instance `xyz2data.tcl`. This script will content all the commands that VMD needs to read the structure of our model and export it to a format compatible with LAMMPS. Below is the general structure you should follow to obtain an appropriate LAMMPS data file:

**1.1. Loading the structure**
We should first include in the script a line to load our structure `CSHmodel_filled.xyz`. Using the command `mol new`, VMD opens the .xyz structure and reads the coordinates.
```
mol new CSHmodel_filled.xyz type xyz
```
**1.2. Loading the plugins**
To manipulate the molecular topology and define the simulation cell, VMD uses two plugins:
- *TopoTools* provides a set of commands to manipulate molecular topologies and export them to formats compatible with LAMMPS.
- *PBCtools* allows handling and visualising periodic boundary conditions (PBC).
To load both, we need to use the following commands:
```
package require topotools
package require pbctools
```

**1.3. Defining the simulation box** 
Next, we have set the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) for our system using the `pbc set`command. The first three numbers correspond to the box dimensions along *x*, *y*, and *z* (in Å), and the last three specify the angles between the box edges. Make sure these values **match those** of the actual model (check them in the `.xyz` file or in OVITO).
```
pbc set {20.0 20.0 20.0 90.0 90.0 90.0}
pbc box
```

**1.4. Assigning masses, charges, and radius**
By default, VMD does not assign atomic charges and must therefore be entered manually following the parameters defined in ClayFF (Table 1). However, VMD automatically assigns atomic masses and radii based on the detected chemical element. To do so, VMD reads the first one or two characters of the atom name to guess the element type, which can lead to misinterpretations when using custom atom labels. For example, an atom named Osi will be read as Os (osmium) instead of O (oxygen). For that reason, it is advisable to reassign the correct mass and radius values for each atom type (see the **Warning** below before setting the radii). To set the correct physical properties for **each** atom type use:

```
set Osi [atomselect top "name Osi"]
$Osi set radius XX
$Osi set charge XX
$Osi set mass XX
```

```{Warning}
**Avoiding unwanted bonds and angles in ClayFF systems.** When using TopoTools to guess bonds and angles, it automatically generates all possible connections based on interatomic distances. However, in ClayFF only hydroxyl and water molecules should contain explicit bonds and angles. If you keep the default settings, VMD will create unnecessary bonds and angles such as *Ca–O_w* or *Si–O_br–Si*. To avoid this, you can **assign a radius of zero to atoms that should not form bonds** before recalculating connectivity (`mol reanalyze top`). 
```
**1.5. Rebuilding the topology**
After assigning all atomic properties, VMD can reconstruct the molecular connectivity (bonds and angles) using the following commands:
```
mol bondsrecalc top
topo guessangles
```

Once all this is done, reanalyse the molecule to ensure that the topology is fully consistent by typing:
```
mol reanalyze top
```

**1.6. Exporting the LAMMPS data file**
Finally, write the topology into a LAMMPS-compatible format using:
```
topo writelammpsdata atoms.data full
exit
```
This command creates the file `atoms.data` in the `full` style, which includes all atom, bond, and angle information required by LAMMPS. You can open it in any text editor to check its structure — you should see sections such as *Masses*, *Atoms*, *Bonds*, and *Angles*. This file is now ready to be combined with the force-field parameters in your LAMMPS input script.


**2. Running VMD with a Tcl script**

Once your Tcl script (e.g. `xyz2data.tcl`) is ready, the next step is to run it directly from the terminal. To do this, we should call the VMD executable and use the option `-dispdev text` to execute the Tcl script specified after `-e`. Note that both the `.xyz` file and the `.tcl` script must be located in the same directory, and you should execute VMD from that directory.
```
vmd -dispdev text -e xyz2data.tcl
```

This starts VMD without opening the graphical interface, automatically loads the `.xyz` file, applies all the steps in the script, and writes the output file `.data` in the current working directory.

```{Tip}
If your terminal does not recognise the `vmd` command, use the full path to the executable (e.g. on macOS: `"/Applications/VMD 1.9.4a51.app/Contents/vmd/vmd_MACOSXX86_64" -dispdev text -e xyz2data.tcl`).  
```
