# Topology

In any molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package, a **topology** file (sometimes also called a _structure_ or _data file_) is a critical file for the simulation. While the input script tells the program _how to run_ the dynamics (ensembles, temperature control, run length, etc.), the topology tells it _what system_ is being simulated. This includes a complete description of all particles: their identifiers, element or species type, masses, charges, and spatial coordinates, along with the connectivity information that defines which atoms are bonded, and how angles and dihedrals are defined. Without such information, the force field cannot assign the correct interactions. In short, the topology is the “map” that defines the system at the atomic scale.

Constructing this file correctly is often the most tedious part of a simulation. In a system with more than 1,000 atoms, it is necessary to define thousands of bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc., which is not straightforward. Here, we will build the topology file using **VMD** (Visual Molecular Dynamics) starting from the atomic structure generated by the pyCSH code. VMD is a molecular visualisation program for biomolecular systems, but it is useful for preparing topology files for LAMMPS.

### LAMMPS topology file

```{Note}
Users with experience with force fields that require topology (ClayFF, CSHFF, CHARMM, OPLS, etc.) can skip this section.
```

In LAMMPS, the topological information is usually stored in a **data file**, which is read using the `read_data` command. The structure of this file is modular and well defined:

- A **header** section specifies the total and type numbers of atoms, bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers, as well as the dimensions of the simulation box.
- A **Masses** section assigns masses to each atom type.
- An **Atoms** section provides, for each atom, its ID, molecule ID (if relevant), atom type, charge, and coordinates (x, y, z). Depending on the chosen `atom_style` in the input file, additional fields may appear, such as velocities, dipoles, or extra properties.
- Optional **Bonds, Angles, Dihedrals, and Impropers** sections describe bonded connectivity, listing the IDs of the participating atoms and their type.

As an example, the following snippet shows a LAMMPS data file for a water molecule:

```lammps

2 1 2  0.410  10.0  8.1 10.0   # H_w (water hydrogen)
3 1 2  0.410  10.0  8.1 10.0   # H_w (water hydrogen)

Bonds # bond-ID bond-type atom1 atom2

1 1 1 2   # O_w – H_w (water bond)
2 1 1 3   # O_w – H_w (water bond)

Angles # angle-ID angle-type atom1 atom2 atom3

1 1 2 1 3  # H_w – O_w – H_w (water angle) 
```

```{Note}
**Atom styles and force fields** The structure of a LAMMPS data file partly depends on the force field being used, as each force field requires a specific `atom_style`. For instance, classical force fields such as CHARMM, AMBER, or ClayFF use the `full` style. This format explicitly lists all topological terms (bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers) together with atom types, masses, charges, and coordinates. In contrast, ReaxFF does not rely on predefined connectivity and the data files should use the `charge` style, which only specifies atom IDs, types, charges, masses, and coordinates.  

Regardless of the force field, the **data file must be consistent with the `atom_style` defined in the input script**, otherwise the simulation will fail to read it correctly. You can find a complete description of all available atom styles and their required fields in the [LAMMPS documentation](https://docs.lammps.org/atom_style.html).

### ClayFF atom types 

[ClayFF](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp0363287) was originally developed to describe clays and layered silicates, but has become common for modelling calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) and related phases. Its key advantage lies in its simplicity: ClayFF is essentially a non-bonded force field in which most atoms interact only through Lennard–Jones and Coulombic terms. The only exceptions are hydroxyl and water molecules, where explicit O–H bonds and H–O–H angles are included to preserve molecular geometry. The assigned charges are fractional (e.g., O ≈ –1.05 e and Si ≈ +2.1 e instead their formal charges -2 and +4) and were originally parameterised for clay minerals (see the **Caution** note).

ClayFF defines a limited set of atom types, each with specific Lennard–Jones parameters and partial charges. pyCSH writes a detailed label for each atom type, and you need to understand their correspondence:

```{Caution}
Clays are phyllosilicates, whereas tobermorite minerals and C–S–H are inosilicates, so applying ClayFF’s standard partial charges to these systems results in a non-neutral configuration. Maintaining electroneutrality is crucial for obtaining stable and physically meaningful simulations. It is **essential** to ensure that your system is **neutral**, i.e. the sum of both the formal and partial charges equals zero. For that, the partial charges can be slightly adjusted.

**IMPORTANT**: the same issue applies to any force field with partial charges when "defects" are introduced, such as CSHFF, OPLS, etc.
```

To solve the charge problem, count the numer of atoms of each element (M), multiply it by its partial charge (qj), and sum over all the elements (N). The sum (Q) must be zero, else, divide the resulting charge by all the CSH oxygen atoms (O, Osi, Oca):

$$
Q = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{M} q_j    \qquad  \qquad  q_{new} = q_{old} - Q/N_{O}
$$

This approach is valid, if the charge is modified by a tiny percentaje (less than 0.005%). This way, the impact in the coulombic interactions is negligible, and the force field is expected to perform as the original.   


### Novice users: step-by-step guide to generate the topology file in VMD

In this section, we will create a LAMMPS data file from the structure generated by pyCSH, using VMD and its plugin *TopoTools*. 

**1. Loading the structure in VMD**

Open VMD and load your structure by going to `File → New Molecule`. In the window that appears, click `Browse`, select your `.xyz` file (or drag and drop). 

**2. Loading TopoTools and PBCtools to create the LAMMPS data file**

*TopoTools* is a VMD plugin that provides a set of commands to manipulate molecular topologies and export them to formats compatible with LAMMPS. The *PBCtools* package, in turn, allows handling and visualising periodic boundary conditions (PBC). To load both, open the `Tk Console` by clicking on `Extensions/Tk Console` and type:
```
package require topotools
package require pbctools
```

**3. Defining the simulation box** 

Next, set the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) for your system. The first three numbers correspond to the box dimensions along *x*, *y*, and *z* (in Å), and the last three specify the angles between the box edges. Make sure these values **match those** of your model (check in the `.xyz` or in OVITO):
```
pbc set {20.0 20.0 20.0 90.0 90.0 90.0}
pbc box
```

**4. Generating bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers**

Now use TopoTools to reconstruct the molecular topology from the atomic coordinates. VMD automatically assigns the chemical element, charge and mass based on the first one or two characters of its name. This simple rule can leads to misassignments when using custom atom names. For instance, if you rename calcium to `Cw`, VMD will treat it as carbon (C) or an oxygen atom renamed to Osi will be interpreted as a osmium. To fix this issue while preserving your custom atom names, you need to manually set the correct physical properties for **each** atom type (see the warning before to set correctly the radius):

```
set Osi [atomselect top "name Osi"]
$Osi set radius XX
$Osi set charge XX
$Osi set mass XX
```

```{Warning}
**Avoiding unwanted bonds and angles in ClayFF systems.** When using TopoTools to guess bonds and angles, it automatically generates all possible connections based on interatomic distances. However, in ClayFF only hydroxyl and water molecules should contain explicit bonds and angles. If you keep the default settings, VMD will create unnecessary bonds and angles such as *Ca–O_w* or *Si–O_br–Si*. To avoid this, you can **assign a radius of zero to atoms that should not form bonds** before recalculating connectivity (`mol reanalyze top`). 
```

The following commands recalculate bonds and then generate angle, dihedral, and improper (used to maintain planarity in certain molecular structures) terms:
```
mol bondsrecalc top
topo guessangles
```

Once all this is done, reanalyse the molecule to ensure that the topology is fully consistent by typing:
```
mol reanalyze top
```

**5. Writing the LAMMPS data file:**

Finally, export the topology into a LAMMPS-compatible format using:
```
topo writelammpsdata atoms.data full
```
This command creates the file `atoms.data` in the `full` style, which includes all atom, bond, angle, and dihedral information required by LAMMPS. You can open it in any text editor to check its structure — you should see sections such as *Masses*, *Atoms*, *Bonds*, and *Angles*. This file is now ready to be combined with the force-field parameters in your LAMMPS input script.


### Advanced users: script based construction

Instead of opening VMD and typing commands in the `Tk Console`, you can run VMD directy from the terminal and execute all steps automatically with a *Tcl script*. A Tcl script is a plain-text file containing the VMD commands you would otherwise type manually in the Tk Console. This approach is ideal for automating workflows: once your Tcl script works for one structure, it can be easily reused to generate multiple data files — for example, for a series of C–S–H models with different Ca/Si ratios — by creating an additional shell script that calls the same Tcl pipeline for each `.xyz` file. This allows you to build many systems in sequence without any manual intervention.

**1. Building the Tcl script**

The first step is to create a Tcl script (a text file with the extension `.tcl`) that VMD will read and execute line by line. Each command inside corresponds to what you would type in the Tk Console (see section above), but grouped into a single automated workflow. The only difference is that you must include an additional command `mol new CSHmodel_filled.xyz type xyz` (where *system* is the name of your structure) at the beginning to load the structure to be processed. Therefore, the Tcl script should:

- **Load the structure** of the system, the `.xyz` file. 
- **Load the necessary packages**, such as `topotools` and `pbctools`.  
- **Define the simulation box dimensions**, using `pbc set`.  
- **Assign correctly the elements** to any custom-named atoms (fix mislabelled atoms).  
- **Set atomic masses and charges**, following the ClayFF parameters.
- **Set radious**, assigning radius zero to atoms that must not form bonds.
- **Rebuild the topology**, using `mol bondsrecalc` and `topo guessangles`.  
- **Export** the system using `topo writelammpsdata`.
  
**2. Running VMD with a Tcl script**

Once your Tcl script (e.g. `xyz2data.tcl`) is ready, the next step is to run it directly from the terminal. To do this, we should call the VMD executable in and use the option `-dispdev text` to excute the Tcl script specified after `-e`:
```
vmd -dispdev text -e xyz2data.tcl
```

This starts VMD without the graphical interface, loads your `.xyz` structure with `type xyz`, applies all steps in the script, and writes `atoms.data` in the current working directory.

This starts VMD without opening the graphical interface, automatically loads the `.xyz` file, applies all the steps in the script, and writes the output file `.data in the current working directory.

```{Tip}
If your terminal does not recognise the `vmd` command, use the full path to the executable (e.g. on macOS: `"/Applications/VMD 1.9.4a51.app/Contents/vmd/vmd_MACOSXX86_64" -dispdev text -e xyz2data.tcl`).  
```
