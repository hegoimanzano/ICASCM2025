# Topology

In any molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package, a **topology** file (sometimes also called a _structure_ or _data file_) is the foundation of the entire simulation. While the input script tells the program _how to run_ the dynamics (ensembles, temperature control, run length), the topology tells it _what system_ is being simulated. This includes a complete description of all particles: their identifiers, element or species type, masses, charges, and spatial coordinates, along with the connectivity information that defines which atoms are bonded, and how angles and dihedrals are organized. Without such information, the force field cannot assign the correct interactions—bond stretching, angle bending, torsional rotations, and nonbonded forces—so the MD code would be unable to calculate energies and forces consistently. In short, the topology is the “map” that defines the system at the atomic scale.

Constructing this file correctly is often the most delicate part of preparing a simulation. In a system with more than 1000 atoms, it is necessary to define thousands of bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc, which is not straightforward. Here, we will build the topology file using **VMD** (Visual Molecular Dynamics) starting from the atomic structure generated by the pyCSH code (see [Casar *et al.*, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2024.107593)). VMD is a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems using 3D graphics and built-in scripting. It is particularly useful for preparing input files for molecular dynamics simulations with software such as LAMMPS.

```{Note}
There are alternative ways to generate topology files, from automated tools such as LigParGen or Moltemplate, to custom scripts using Python and ASE. Each method offers different levels of flexibility and complexity — for instance, LigParGen is mainly suited for small organic molecules, while Python-based approaches are better for larger or more specialized systems.

### LAMMPS topology file

In LAMMPS, the topological information is usually stored in a **data file**, which is read using the `read_data` command. The structure of this file is modular and well defined:

- A **header** section specifies the total and type numbers of atoms, bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers, as well as the dimensions of the simulation box.
- A **Masses** section assigns masses to each atom type.
- An **Atoms** section provides, for each atom, its ID, molecule ID (if relevant), atom type, charge, and coordinates (x, y, z). Depending on the chosen `atom_style` in the input file, additional fields may appear (such as velocities, dipoles, or extra properties).
- Optional **Bonds, Angles, Dihedrals, and Impropers** sections describe bonded connectivity, listing the IDs of the participating atoms and their type.

### ClayFF atom types 

An important example relevant to hydrated oxides and cementitious materials is the ClayFF force field. ClayFF was designed to describe clays and layered silicates but has since become the de facto standard for modeling calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) and related phases. Its key philosophy is simplicity: ClayFF is essentially a nonbonded force field, in which most atoms interact only through Lennard–Jones and Coulombic terms. The only exceptions are hydroxyl and water molecules, where explicit O–H bonds and H–O–H angles are included (following the flexible SPC water model)to preserve molecular geometry. In practice, this means that framework atoms such as Si, Al, and Ca are modeled as charged point particles interacting electrostatically with oxygens and hydroxyls, without any explicit bond definition.

ClayFF defines a limited set of atom types, each with specific Lennard–Jones parameters and partial charges. Typical species include:
	•	O_br (bridging oxygen): oxygens linking tetrahedra.
	•	O_H (hydroxyl oxygen) and H (hydroxyl hydrogen): forming bonded terms.
	•	Tetrahedral cations (Si, Al_t).
	•	Octahedral cations (Al_o, Mg, Fe, Ca).
	•	Interlayer water molecules (O_w, H_w).
	•	Common aqueous ions (Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Cl⁻)

Charges are fractional (e.g., O_br ≈ –1.05 e, Si ≈ +2.1 e) and were derived from DFT calculations on simple oxides and hydroxides to reproduce structural and hydration properties of silicates. This minimal parametrization has several advantages: it makes ClayFF easy to extend to new systems, computationally efficient, and sufficiently flexible to describe the disordered, gel-like nature of C–S–H. Because most interactions are nonbonded, ClayFF allows bonds to break and reform in a way that mimics structural flexibility, which is crucial when studying diffusion of ions and the behavior of confined water in cementitious pores.

```{Warning}
Unlike crystalline minerals, disordered phases such as C–S–H do not have a fixed stoichiometry, so applying ClayFF’s standard partial charges often results in a non-neutral system. Maintaining near-electroneutrality is crucial for obtaining stable and physically meaningful simulations, so always check the total charge after building your model:
- If the net charge is small (|Q| < 0.1 e), it can be compensated by the Ewald solver.  
- For larger imbalances, add counterions (e.g., Cl⁻, OH⁻) or slightly adjust the number of hydroxyls or Ca atoms until neutrality is achieved.  
```

### Novel users: step by step guide to generate the topology file in VMD

In this section, we will create a LAMMPS data file from a PDB structure genrated by pyCSH using VMD and its plugin *TopoTools*. 

**1. Loading the PDB file in VMD**
Open VMD and load your structure by going to `File → New Molecule`. In the window that appears, click `Browse`, select your `.pdb` file, and then click `Load` to visualize it in the main display.


**2. Loading TopoTools and PBCtools to create the LAMMPS data file**
TopoTools is a VMD plugin that provides a set of commands to manipulate molecular topologies and export them to formats compatible with LAMMPS. The `PBCtools` package, in turn, allows handling and visualizing periodic boundary conditions. To load both, open the `Tk Console` by clicking in `Extensions/Tk Console` and type:
```
package require topotools
package require pbctools
```

**3. Defining simulation box** 
Next, set the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) for your system. The first three numbers correspond to the box dimensions along x, y, and z (in Å), and the last three specify the angles between box edges. Make sure these values match those defined in the structure generated by pyCSH:
```
pbc set {20.0 20.0 20.0 90.0 90.0 90.0}
```

**4. Generating bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers**
Now use TopoTools to reconstruct the molecular topology from the atomic coordinates. The following commands recalculate bonds, then generate angle, dihedral, and improper (used to maintain planarity in certain molecular structures) terms as needed:
```
mol bondsrecalc top
topo guessangles
topo guessdihedrals
topo guessimpropers
```
Once this is done, reanalyze the molecule to ensure that the topology is fully consistent by typing:
```
mol reanalyze top
```

**5. Assigning atomic charges**
Atomic charges must be defined explicitly using the partial charges defined in ClayFF:
```
set Si [atomselect top "name Si"]
$Si set charge 2.10
set O_br [atomselect top "name O_br"]
$O_br set charge -1.05
```

**6. Writing the LAMMPS data file:**

Finally, export the topology into a LAMMPS-readable format using:
```
topo writelammpsdata atoms.data full
```
This command creates the file `atoms.data` in the `full` style, which includes all atom, bond, angle, and dihedral information required by LAMMPS. You can open it in any text editor to check its structure — you should see sections such as *Masses*, *Atoms*, *Bonds*, and *Angles*. This file is now ready to be combined with the force-field parameters in your LAMMPS input script.


```{Warning} 

**Handling mislabeled atoms in VMD**

When atom names are changed from their standard chemical symbols (for example, naming aqueous Ca as `Cw` to distinguish it from interlayer Ca), **VMD may misinterpret them as different elements**. For instance, if you rename calcium to `Cw`, VMD will treat it as carbon (C), assigning an incorrect mass (12.01 instead of 40.08) and radius, which can affect bond recognition.
To fix this issue while keeping your custom names, you need to manually set the correct element by typing:
```
set Cw [atomselect top "name Cw"]
$Cw set element Ca
```
