# Topology

In any molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package, a **topology** file (sometimes also called a _structure_ or _data file_) is a critical file for the simulation. While the input script tells the program _how to run_ the dynamics (ensembles, temperature control, run length), the topology tells it _what system_ is being simulated. This includes a complete description of all particles: their identifiers, element or species type, masses, charges, and spatial coordinates, along with the connectivity information that defines which atoms are bonded, and how angles and dihedrals are organized. Without such information, the force field cannot assign the correct interactions (bond stretching, angle bending, torsional rotations, and nonbonded forces). In short, the topology is the “map” that defines the system at the atomic scale.

Constructing this file correctly is often the most tedious part of a simulation. In a system with more than 1000 atoms, it is necessary to define thousands of bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc, which is not straightforward. Here, we will build the topology file using **VMD** (Visual Molecular Dynamics) starting from the atomic structure generated by the pyCSH code. VMD is a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems using 3D graphics and built-in scripting. It is particularly useful for preparing input files for molecular dynamics simulations with software such as LAMMPS.

### LAMMPS topology file

```{Note}
Users with experience with Force Fields that require topology (ClayFF, CSHFF, CHARMM, OPLS, etc) can skip this section.
```

In LAMMPS, the topological information is usually stored in a **data file**, which is read using the `read_data` command. The structure of this file is modular and well defined:

- A **header** section specifies the total and type numbers of atoms, bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers, as well as the dimensions of the simulation box.
- A **Masses** section assigns masses to each atom type.
- An **Atoms** section provides, for each atom, its ID, molecule ID (if relevant), atom type, charge, and coordinates (x, y, z). Depending on the chosen `atom_style` in the input file, additional fields may appear (such as velocities, dipoles, or extra properties).
- Optional **Bonds, Angles, Dihedrals, and Impropers** sections describe bonded connectivity, listing the IDs of the participating atoms and their type.

```{Note}
**Atom styles and force fields** Part of the LAMMPS data file depends on the force field that is going to be used. The force field determines the appropriate `atom_style` to be used. For example, classical force fields such as CHARMM, AMBER, or ClayFF require the style `full`, which explicitly includes all bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers, as well as atom types, masses, charges, and coordinates. In contrast,  ReaxFF do not need predefined connectivity terms and the data file should use the `charge` style, which only specifies atom IDs, types, charges, masses, and coordinates. In any case, the **data file must match the `atom_style`** otherwise, the simulation will fail to read it correctly. You can find a full description of all available atom styles and their required fields in the [LAMMPS documentation](https://docs.lammps.org/atom_style.html).

### ClayFF atom types 

ClayFF was designed to describe clays and layered silicates, but has become common for modeling calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) and related phases. Its key advantage is simplicity: ClayFF is essentially a nonbonded force field, in which most atoms interact only through Lennard–Jones and Coulombic terms. The only exceptions are hydroxyl and water molecules, where explicit O–H bonds and H–O–H angles are included to preserve molecular geometry. This means that framework atoms such as Si, Al, and Ca are modeled as charged point particles interacting electrostatically with oxygens and hydroxyls, without any explicit bond definition. Charges are fractional (e.g., O_br ≈ –1.05 e, Si ≈ +2.1 e) and designed for clay minerals (see the **Caution** note)

ClayFF defines a limited set of atom types, each with specific Lennard–Jones parameters and partial charges. Typical species include:
- O_br (bridging oxygen): oxygens linking tetrahedra.
- O_H (hydroxyl oxygen) and H (hydroxyl hydrogen): forming bonded terms.
- Tetrahedral cations (Si, Al_t).
- Octahedral cations (Al_o, Mg, Fe, Ca).
- Interlayer water molecules (O_w, H_w).
- Common aqueous ions (Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Cl⁻, etc)

```{Caution}
Clays are phyllosilicates, while tobermorite-minerals and C–S–H are inosilicates, so applying ClayFF’s standard partial charges results in a non-neutral system. Maintaining electroneutrality is crucial for obtaining stable and physically meaningful simulations. You **always** need to be sure that your system is **_formally_** neutral, i.e. the summatory of the formal charges is zero. Then, the partial charges can be slightly tuned
 - If the net charge is small (|Q| < 0.1 e), it can be compensated by the Ewald solver.  
 - If the net charge is large (|Q| > 0.1 e), you need to adjust the standard charges in your model. The easiest way is to modify the charge in the silicate oxygen atoms by a tiny percentage (less than 0.05%). Ideally, the force field paramentes should be rescaled, but we can assume that such a tiny charge modification will not affect the physics

**IMPORTANT**: same issue applies to any force field with partial charges when "defects" are introduced, as CSHFF, OPLS, etc.

### Novel users: step by step guide to generate the topology file in VMD

In this section, we will create a LAMMPS data file from a PDB structure genrated by pyCSH using VMD and its plugin *TopoTools*. 

**1. Loading the PDB file in VMD**

Open VMD and load your structure by going to `File → New Molecule`. In the window that appears, click `Browse`, select your `.pdb` file, and then click `Load` to visualize it in the main display.


**2. Loading TopoTools and PBCtools to create the LAMMPS data file**

*TopoTools* is a VMD plugin that provides a set of commands to manipulate molecular topologies and export them to formats compatible with LAMMPS. The *PBCtools* package, in turn, allows handling and visualizing periodic boundary conditions. To load both, open the `Tk Console` by clicking in `Extensions/Tk Console` and type:
```
package require topotools
package require pbctools
```

**3. Defining simulation box** 

Next, set the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) for your system. The first three numbers correspond to the box dimensions along x, y, and z (in Å), and the last three specify the angles between box edges. Make sure these values match those defined in the structure generated by pyCSH:
```
pbc set {20.0 20.0 20.0 90.0 90.0 90.0}
```

**4. Generating bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers**

Now use TopoTools to reconstruct the molecular topology from the atomic coordinates. The following commands recalculate bonds, then generate angle, dihedral, and improper (used to maintain planarity in certain molecular structures) terms as needed:
```
mol bondsrecalc top
topo guessangles
topo guessdihedrals
topo guessimpropers
```

Once this is done, reanalyze the molecule to ensure that the topology is fully consistent by typing:
```
mol reanalyze top
```

**5. Assigning atomic charges**

Atomic charges must be defined explicitly using the partial charges defined in ClayFF:

```
set Si [atomselect top "name Si"]
$Si set charge 2.10
set O_br [atomselect top "name O_br"]
$O_br set charge -1.05
...
```

**6. Writing the LAMMPS data file:**

Finally, export the topology into a LAMMPS-readable format using:

```
topo writelammpsdata atoms.data full
```
This command creates the file `atoms.data` in the `full` style, which includes all atom, bond, angle, and dihedral information required by LAMMPS. You can open it in any text editor to check its structure — you should see sections such as *Masses*, *Atoms*, *Bonds*, and *Angles*. This file is now ready to be combined with the force-field parameters in your LAMMPS input script.


```{Warning} 
**Handling mislabeled atoms in VMD**
When atom names are changed from their standard chemical symbols (for example, naming aqueous Ca as `Cw` to distinguish it from interlayer Ca), **VMD may misinterpret them as different elements**. For instance, if you rename calcium to `Cw`, VMD will treat it as carbon (C), assigning an incorrect mass (12.01 instead of 40.08) and radius, which can affect bond recognition. To fix this issue while keeping your custom names, you need to manually set the correct element by typing:
```

```
set Cw [atomselect top "name Cw"] 
$Cw set element Ca
```


### Advanced users: script based construction

Instead of opening VMD and typing commands in the Tk Console, we can run VMD from the terminal and execute all steps automatically with a **Tcl script**. A Tcl script is just a plain-text file containing the VMD commands you would otherwise type by hand in the Tk Console. This approach is reproducible and easy to share. Once your Tcl script works for one structure, you can easily automate the generation of multiple data files — for example, for a series of C–S–H models with different Ca/Si ratios — by creating an additional shell script that calls the same Tcl pipeline for each PDB file. This allows you to build many systems in sequence without any manual intervention.

**1. Building the Tcl script**

The first step in automating the process is to create a Tcl script. This script (a text file with the extension `.tcl`) works as a command list that VMD will read and execute line by line. Each command inside corresponds to what you would normally type in the Tk Console (see section above), but grouped together. The only difference is that now you include an additional command `mol new system.pdb` (where system is your structure name) at the beginning to load the PDB structure that you want to process. Therefore, the script should:

- **Load the structure** of the system, typically a `.pdb` file. 
- **Load the necessary packages**, such as `topotools` and `pbctools`.  
- **Define the simulation box dimensions**.  
- **Assign correctly the elements** to each atom type, fixing any mislabeled atoms if needed.  
- **Set atomic masses and charges**, as described earlier for ClayFF.  
- **Rebuild the topology**, guessing bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers.  
- **Export** the system using `topo writelammpsdata`.
  

**2. Running VMD with a Tcl script**

Once your Tcl script (for example `make_lammps_data.tcl`) is ready, the next step is to run it directly from the terminal. To do this, we should call the VMD executable in and use the option `-dispdev text` to excute the Tcl script specified after `-e`:

```
vmd -dispdev text -e make_lammps_data.tcl
```

This will start VMD without opening the graphical interface, automatically load the file test.pdb, apply all the steps defined in the script, and write the output file atoms.data in the current working directory.

```{Tip}
Before running this command, make sure you know where the VMD executable is located on your system. If your terminal does not recognize the command vmd, use the full path to the executable in place of vmd in the command above.
```
