# Analysis (MSD & density)

We will analyse the performed MD simulation. The objective is to understand the diffusion and the equilibrium state of Cl ions in the C-S-H slit-(nano)pore.

### Thermodynamic properties and trayectory

It is always desiderable to check the basic thermodynamics properties and do a visual inspection of the trayectory. There are unphysical behaviours that can be observed on one or another. For example, the silicate chains can break, forming an amorphous material that does not represent C-S-H anymore, and yet, the thermodynamic properties can ARROJAR reasonable energies, densities, etc.
