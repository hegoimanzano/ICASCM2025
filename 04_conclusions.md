# Conclusions

- Built C-S-H with a pore, hydrated, and added NaCl with **PyCSH**.
- Ran MD in **LAMMPS**, producing trajectories.
- Analyzed **MSD** and **density profiles** with **MDAnalysis**.

**Extensions**: try other salts (CaCl$_2$), pore sizes, and thermodynamic states. Discuss finite-size effects and ionâ€“surface specificity.
