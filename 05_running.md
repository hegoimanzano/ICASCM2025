# Running the simulation

We have created an input file and a data file, all the necessary files are ready! We will use Atomify, [Atomify](https://andeplane.github.io/atomify/), a web editor running LAMMPS with real time visualization, access to real time plotting of physical quantities and much more. 
After a simulation is finished, all files are available in a jupyter notebook that also runs in the browser. With Atomify, we can run LAMMPS examples in the browser. It runs with about 50% of the speed of natively compiled LAMMPS (single threaded), so this is good for testing and teaching purposes, not for real production.

In Atomify, left menu, click in `New simulation`, give a name to your simulation and drag and drop the input anda data files.
