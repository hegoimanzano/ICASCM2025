### Overall Conclusions of the Course

In this tutorial, we have shown the full workflow of atomistic simulation applied to cementitious materials: (i) building a structural model of C–S–H with a slit pore, (ii) preparing and running a molecular dynamics simulation with LAMMPS, and (iii) analyzing the output to extract physically meaningful properties such as diffusion constants and density distributions.

It is important to stress, however, that the examples presented here are highly simplified. The simulation times are much shorter than those required to obtain converged transport properties, and the models do not yet account for the full structural complexity of real C–S–H. In a research-grade study, one would need to run trajectories hundreds of times longer, carefully test the force field, and validate the results against experimental data.

Despite these limitations, the course provides a paradigmatic case study that illustrates the power and limitations of molecular dynamics for cement science. Students leave the course with a clear view of how atomistic simulations are set up, run, and analyzed, and what steps are necessary to transition from a didactic example to a robust scientific study.

### Future courses

The material from this course will permanently be available. If you use it, you can cite it as (zenodo). New material will be created for future ICASCM courses, tentatively 2027. In adittion, the UPV/EHU will offer an oficial certified 10 hours course on atomistic simulation of cementitious materials in October 2027. The course will be hibrid online / in person. The sites are limited, you can send your expression of interest by mail to eduardo.duque@ehu.eus
