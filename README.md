## Welcome to the hands-on course ICASCM 2025

This github repository contains the material and the instructions designed for the ICASCM 2025. The course is a tutorial featuring an introduction to molecular dynamics simulations of cementitious materials. It provides a first, practical overview of how atomistic simulations can be applied in this field.

The curated tutorial can be found at [ICASCM 2025](https://hegoimanzano.github.io/ICASCM2025/intro.html)
