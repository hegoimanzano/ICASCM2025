# Introduction

Welcome to the **Atomistic Simulation of C-S-H** course manual.
This site is generated with **Jupyter Book** and published via **GitHub Pages**.

**Why this builds reliably on GitHub**
- `execute_notebooks: "off"` avoids executing code on CI.
- You can switch to `"auto"` later if you add scientific dependencies.
