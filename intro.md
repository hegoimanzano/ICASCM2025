# Welcome to the hands-on course ICASCM 2025

This course is designed as a **tutorial** featuring an introduction to **molecular dynamics simulations of cementitious materials**.  
It provides a first, practical overview of how atomistic simulations can be applied in this field.

here we will build a **C-S-H model** and a **C-S-H slit-pore model**, saturated with water and a salt (sodium chloride, NaCl).  

From these models, we will calculate:

- The **diffusion constants** of chloride, sodium, and water.  
- The **density profiles** of the ions inside the pore.  

The idea is to illustrate two different approaches:

- A **simpler route**, for those who are just starting out.  
- A **Python-based route**, which may look more challenging at first, but once you get familiar with some basic steps, it becomes extremely straightforward and allows for a high degree of **automation**.
